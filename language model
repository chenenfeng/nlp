Independence:
IIF P(x,y) = P(x)*P(y)

P(x) = sumy P(y)

Chain Rule: P(x,y,z) = P(x|y,z)P(y,z) = P(x|y,z)P(y|z)P(z)

Bayes Rule: P(x|y) = P(y|x)P(x)/P(y)

P(sentence) = P(W1 = w1, W2 = w2, W3 = w3, ... Wn = wn)
 = P(w1,w2,w3,...wnï¼‰   joint prob of n words
 = P(wn|w1,w2,...wn-1)*P(wn-1|w1,w2,...wn-2)*...   several order  once pick whatever word
 
 Train Data:  can get P(w2|w1) = c(w2 occurs after w1)/c(w1 occurs)
 P(w1) = c(w1 occurs)/N
 
 Prob(wn|"Hi, my name is"]  particular sequence
